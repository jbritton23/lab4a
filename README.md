This application has three main functions set up in button click format the functions are conversions from Fahrenheit to Celcius, Miles to Kilometers, and a function to calculate tip for restaurant bill.  The first two of the aforementioned functions can also calculate in reverse, from KM to miles or from Celcius to Fahrenheit.  The tip caluclator takes the number of guests and divides that into the bill total and multiplies it by the tip percent to give you a tip total.  You can choose which feature you want to use by a three button start screen.  Each button is clearly labeled with which fragment it will direct you to.  Then you just input the appropiate figures and tap calculate and it will display the solution in the label corresponding to the fragment you have selected.
